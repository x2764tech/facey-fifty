Start the climb at its junction with A62 Manchester Road, on the left just before entering Slaithwaite. This is a classic Colne Valley climb as it has some steep sections and sharp bends. The road surface is far from good on a lot of this climb and at first it is steep and bumpy.Once the road starts to bend to the right you pass the magnificent Linthwaite Hall a grade 2 listed building with extremely small windows dating from 1550. Continue up and pass the bowling club before encountering a very sharp and steep “S” bend. Unfortunately the road surface is appalling and you have to pick your way carefully to avoid the worst potholes. The steepness eases as you come out of the bends where the road bends left for a short straight section before again turning left at a sharp bend. The road continues to climb but you are rewarded with magnificent views across the valley before reaching the scrap yard on your left. Once past the scrap yard the road really levels off. I have continued straight onto the “T” Junction by the Blackmoorfoot reservoir to enable you to gain even more views of the valley and the “dark satanic” mills and a little gentle “wind down” before you tackle the next climb.
