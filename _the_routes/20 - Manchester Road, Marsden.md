This climb starts outside the New Inn public house on A62 Manchester Rd immediately after
the pedestrian crossing. This is very much more like an Alpine climb but shorter. It is a
steady consistent climb all the way up to the Standedge cutting where you come to the
Greater Manchester boundary. You can get into a lovely rhythm on this climb, the only thing
that can really upset that or yourself is the head wind which can be very fierce as you come
to open moorland which leaves you very exposed to the elements. If you get the chance to
look around and notice the squat chimneys, one on your left and one on your right near the
top, these are ventilation shafts for the mainline railway tunnel which runs under the
Standedge hillside. The railway tunnel is the fifth longest in England at just over three miles
and the canal tunnel which runs alongside it is the highest and longest in the UK at three
miles and six hundred and sixty yards.
Marsden church often called the Cathedral of the valley near the start of this climb
