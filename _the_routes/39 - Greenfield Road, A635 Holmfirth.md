Average gradient %
This is the main A635 to Manchester and turning right just some three hundred yards from
the traffic lights in the centre of Holmfirth, going towards Holme Moss. This is probably one
of the few climbs that resembles a continental climb in that it is a little longer than most
around here at 4.1 miles. I have selected it because it is a nice steady gradient for the
majority of the distance giving an average gradient of 4.4%. On the way you pass the famous
Compo’s fish and chip shop and then two pubs, The Ford Inn and The Huntsman Inn, before
going through wide open wild moorland up to a height elevation of 1473ft above sea level.
Once again the wind can be a major factor in your speed here!! This climb finishes where
Wessenden Head Road comes in from the right, where sometimes a mobile cafe is situated
in the lay-by opposite.
