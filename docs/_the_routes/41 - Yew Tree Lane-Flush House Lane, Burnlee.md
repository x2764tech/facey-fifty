This one starts about one mile west of Holmfirth off the main road to Holme Moss A6024.
As you approach Hinchliffe Mill, turn right immediately after the “Londis” mini-market and
then left twenty yards later into Yew Tree Lane, where you commence the climb. The hill
starts by passing terrace housing to the left and then into open countryside. The gradient
stays fairly constant at around 9%. There are some tough sections and once the gradient
slackens you will be passing through a small hamlet of houses and farm buildings Turn right
at the next “T” junction and continue to the crossroads. After giving way go straight across
and continue your climb (a nasty drag this bit, it doesn’t look much)! with views of Digley
reservoir and Holme Moss to your left. You complete the climb when you come to the main
A635 Greenfield Road.
